#OVERVIEW
Prototyping a data stream processor in C++.  This is an experiment based on a Reactor Software Design Pattern that uses a circular buffer while ingesting a data stream. The Reactor will ingest data into the Circular Buffer as needed, while simulatansouly processors will parse and handle the incoming data on the Circular.
